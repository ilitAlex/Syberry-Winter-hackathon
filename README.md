Syberry-Winter-hackathon 2020

the task "Local Farmers":

Local Farmers want to bring their community to the client. We need a basic web app where each farmer can register, add their products, amount, photos, and prices, and find their clients. We need to have the main page where every product from every farmer is shown, but the best farmers (based on reviews and products quality) have priority and first numbers on this page. Every now and then we want to make something we call Farmers' Collaboration: a collection of products from several different farmers. This Collaboration is sold in one piece, and it collects products from 3 to 7 registered farmers. Our Clients need not to register, but we need to have a nice cart added to the app, so anybody can buy from us! Add their address, date and time when they are available for delivery, delivery type, and payment option. Every Client and Farmer can leave a review to other Farmers of their products. Any other suggestions are most welcome!
